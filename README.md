# Collection of Computer Graphics Projects
This repository contains a collection of small projects developed for the Computer Graphics exam at University of Bologna.

## LAB 01
This project contains a c++ application for the construction of different types of BÃ©zier curves. The app uses the library OpenGL.

You can read the report for this project [here](LAB_01/LAB_01_report_MG.pdf) (in Italian).
## LAB 02
This project contains a simple demo game developed in c++ with the OpenGL library.
